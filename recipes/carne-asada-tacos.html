        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 jalapeno peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 white onion, quartered</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>4 dried New Mexico chile pods</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) package corn tortillas</li>
        <li>2 cups grated cotija cheese (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 limes, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay the flank steak in a large glass baking dish. In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar, soy
            sauce, 4 cloves of garlic, juice of two limes, and olive oil. Season with salt, black pepper, white
            pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, oregano, cumin and paprika. Whisk until well blended, then pour
            over the steak in the dish. Turn over once to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap, and marinate
            for
            1 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together 1 chopped white onion, cilantro, and the juice of 1 lime. Set aside
            to
            use as a relish for the tacos.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Toast chile pods in the skillet for a few minutes, then remove
            to
            a bowl of water to soak for about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Place the tomatoes, 1 onion, jalapenos, and 4 cloves of garlic onto a baking sheet. Roast in the
            oven
            for about 20 minutes, until toasted but not burnt. Place the roasted vegetables, and soaked chile
            pods
            into a blender or food processor, along with salt and pepper. Puree until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cut the marinated flank steak into
            cubes or
            strips. Cook, stirring constantly, until the meat is cooked through and most of the liquid has
            evaporated.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas in a skillet for about a minute on each side to make them pliable. Tortillas may
            also
            be warmed in a microwave oven. Arrange two or three tortillas on a plate, and lay a generous amount
            of
            beef over them. Top with a sprinkle of the onion relish and a large spoonful of the pureed salsa.
            Add as
            much cheese as you like. Garnish with lime wedges, and serve.</li>
